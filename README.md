# Tetris
This is a very simple implementation of the popular tetris game, is a capstone project for [boot.dev](boot.dev)

![](README/tetris.png)The only feature from modern Tetris i kind of implemented by accident was the side wall kicks: was not aware it's a thing. That said, it's not really doing the complex official wall kick and also it's not implemented against other pieces.

Most probably there are bugs, the scoring is mega simple ( 100 points per line), but was an excellent project overall.
